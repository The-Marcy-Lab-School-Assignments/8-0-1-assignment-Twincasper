# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
A middleware function passes the request to another controller, whereas a normal controller sends out the response. In other words, middleware is an extension cord that takes in electricity(request) and redirects the flow to the actual outlet which directly delivers the power(response) itself.
